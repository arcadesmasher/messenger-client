A basic Instant Messaging frontend (MSN Messenger replica) made with Angular, for the sake of learning more about Angular.

# Features:

* Registration/login

* Receiving/sending messages (well, of course, since that this is a chat app)

* Finding the users via their e-mail addresses registered on the system 

* New message notifications whenever a message is received
